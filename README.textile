h2. Objective examples

You can create your own objective builders, with the required conditions that your goal achiever requires.
Mikyung provides one objective builder called *RelationDrivenObjective* to describe how to use it. The following example shows how to achieve a buying objective:

[pre]
class Buy < RelationDrivenObjective
  
  executes FinishesOrder, :when => has_relation(:payment)
  executes PickProduct, :when => has_relation(:basket)
  executes SearchProducts, :when => has_relation(:search)

  def completed?(resource)
    resource.respond_to?(:status) && resource.status == "paid"
  end
  
end
[/pre]



A less declarative approach is to implement both the completed? and *next_step* methods:

[pre]
class Buy
  
  def completed?(resource)
    resource.respond_to?(:status) && resource.status == "paid"
  end
  
  def next_step(resource)
    options = [ ["payment", FinishesOrder], ["basket", PickProduct], ["search", SearchProducts]]
    step = options.find do |k|
      resource.respond_to?(k.first)
    end
    step ? step.last : nil
  end
  
end
[/pre]
